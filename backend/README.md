### Getting started

### Prerequisites

## Step 1: Installing packages

Install the required dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

Tip: If `yarn install` does not work, try deleting the `node_modules` directory and rerunning `yarn install`.

## Step 2: Setup

rename `env.example` file to `.env`. All the variables are already set in this file as there are no secrets. If we add the secrets such as access_key, DO NOT push this file to repository

## Step 3: Run

- Run the following command to run it in development mode:

```
npm run dev
```

REST API is running at `http://<host name>:5000`.
